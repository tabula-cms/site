## What this is

This repository is the public site of [Tabula](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula), a free,
open-source, self-hosted CMS for Ukrainian schools (AGPL-3.0). The site has two parts: (1)
documentation for schools and developers, built at build time from the `docs/` folder of
`tabula-cms/tabula`, and (2) — later — a catalogue of schools running Tabula (a Cloudflare
Worker + KV).

`tabula-cms/tabula` is the single source of truth for documentation text. This repository
never edits doc text; it only imports it. Everything else (site chrome, catalogue, CI, deploy)
lives here.

## Working process

1. The lead session (Fable) writes the spec into the issue (English for a technical spec,
   Ukrainian for a bug/content issue; acceptance criteria in Gherkin).
2. A work branch is created for it.
3. The `implementer` agent (Sonnet) writes the code/files from a brief written for that issue.
4. The `reviewer` agent (Opus) reviews the change against the issue's acceptance criteria and
   this file's conventions.
5. The implementer (or the lead) applies fixes from the review.
6. The lead session commits, pushes, and opens the pull request with `Closes #N`.
7. Merge after the `build` check is green.

Agents never run `git` (the reviewer may run read-only `git diff`/`git status`/`git log`).
Briefs live in the session scratchpad, not in this repository.

## Branch and deploy model

`main` is the only long-lived branch and is always live. Work branches are `feature/…`,
`fix/…`, `chore/…`, one PR per issue, squash merge allowed. `main` is protected and requires
the `build` check. Deploy target is GitHub Pages, built by GitHub Actions from `main`, with a
daily scheduled rebuild (so doc changes in `tabula-cms/tabula` reach the site without a PR
here). The site builds from `tabula-cms/tabula`'s `main` (its released state), not `develop`.
`deploy.yml` also takes a manual `workflow_dispatch` with a `tabula_ref` input (default
`main`), so a `develop` preview build can be triggered by hand; that preview is overwritten by
the next scheduled run against `main`. `SITE_URL` and `SITE_BASE` are repository variables
consumed by the build. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the manual repository settings this depends
on.

## Conventions

- Languages: user-facing text is Ukrainian; developer-facing files and code are English.
- Acceptance criteria: Gherkin keywords in English, scenario text in Ukrainian (Ukrainian
  issues) or English (English specs).
- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment next to
  it; Dependabot keeps both current.
- No real school, city, person, or domain anywhere in this repository. The only example school
  is the fictitious «Вигаданий ліцей № 0»; screenshots come only from the fixture school.
- Documentation text is never edited in this repository — fix it in `tabula-cms/tabula`.
- Generated doc folders (`src/content/docs/{editor,install,qa,dev}/`) are gitignored and never
  committed.

## Commands

Arriving with issues #2–#4:

npm ci
TABULA_DOCS_DIR=../tabula/docs npm run docs:fetch
npm run dev
npm run build

## Related repositories

[`tabula-cms/tabula`](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula): default branch `develop`, `main`
is what's released. Its `docs/` folder layout: `INDEX.md`, `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/`,
`dev/`, `issues/` — `INDEX.md` and `issues/` are internal and are not published on this site.
Page language: `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/` are Ukrainian; `dev/` is English and is imported
with `lang: en` on its content collection.

## Where decisions are recorded

The branch, deploy, and process model in this file was decided in issue #1 of this repository.
The overall plan and issue sequence is issue #10.
