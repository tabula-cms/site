## What this is

This repository is the public site of [Tabula](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula), a free,
open-source, self-hosted CMS for Ukrainian schools (AGPL-3.0). The site has two parts: (1)
documentation for schools and developers, built at build time from the `docs/` folder of
`tabula-cms/tabula`, and (2) — later — a catalogue of schools running Tabula (a Cloudflare
Worker + KV).

`tabula-cms/tabula` is the single source of truth for documentation text. This repository
never edits doc text; it only imports it. Everything else (site chrome, catalogue, CI, deploy)
lives here.

## Working process

1. The lead session (Fable) writes the spec into the issue (English for a technical spec,
   Ukrainian for a bug/content issue; acceptance criteria in Gherkin).
2. A work branch is created for it.
3. The `implementer` agent (Sonnet) writes the code/files from a brief written for that issue.
4. The `reviewer` agent (Opus) reviews the change against the issue's acceptance criteria and
   this file's conventions.
5. The implementer (or the lead) applies fixes from the review.
6. The lead session commits, pushes, and opens the pull request with `Closes #N`.
7. Merge after the `build` check is green.

Agents never run `git` (the reviewer may run read-only `git diff`/`git status`/`git log`).
Briefs live in the session scratchpad, not in this repository.

## Branch and deploy model

`main` is the only long-lived branch and is always live. Work branches are `feature/…`,
`fix/…`, `chore/…`, one PR per issue, squash merge allowed. `main` is protected and requires
the `build` check. Deploy target is GitHub Pages, built by GitHub Actions from `main`, with a
daily scheduled rebuild (so doc changes in `tabula-cms/tabula` reach the site without a PR
here). The site builds from `tabula-cms/tabula`'s `main` (its released state), not `develop`.
`deploy.yml` also takes a manual `workflow_dispatch` with a `tabula_ref` input (default
`main`), so a `develop` preview build can be triggered by hand; that preview is overwritten by
the next scheduled run against `main`. `SITE_URL` and `SITE_BASE` are repository variables
consumed by the build. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the manual repository settings this depends
on.

## Conventions

- Languages: user-facing text is Ukrainian; developer-facing files and code are English.
- Acceptance criteria: Gherkin keywords in English, scenario text in Ukrainian (Ukrainian
  issues) or English (English specs).
- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment next to
  it; Dependabot keeps both current.
- No real school, city, person, or domain anywhere in this repository. The only example school
  is the fictitious «Вигаданий ліцей № 0»; screenshots come only from the fixture school.
- Documentation text is never edited in this repository — fix it in `tabula-cms/tabula`.
- Generated doc folders (`src/content/docs/{editor,install,qa,dev}/`) are gitignored and never
  committed; `src/content/docs/index.mdx` (the landing page) is the only content file
  committed.
- Node: 22 (Astro 7 requires `>=22.12.0`); see `.nvmrc` and `package.json`'s `engines.node`.
- `astro.config.mjs`'s `site`/`base` default to the GitHub Pages project URL
  (`https://tabula-cms.github.io` / `/site`) and are overridden by the `SITE_URL`/`SITE_BASE`
  repository variables in CI; the custom domain later sets `SITE_BASE=/`. Internal links in
  `src/content/docs/index.mdx` (e.g. the hero actions) are written without a leading slash
  (`editor/`, not `/editor/`) so they resolve under either base — Starlight does not rewrite
  frontmatter link fields for the configured `base` itself.
- The sidebar's four groups (`editor`, `install`, `qa`, `dev`) are only added to
  `astro.config.mjs`'s `sidebar` array when the matching `src/content/docs/<dir>` folder
  exists (checked with `node:fs`'s `existsSync`). This is cosmetic, not a build requirement —
  an autogenerated group whose directory doesn't exist still builds fine, it would just show
  an empty group in the sidebar before that section has been imported. Those folders are
  generated by `scripts/fetch-docs.mjs` (issue #3) and gitignored, so a fresh clone that
  hasn't run `docs:fetch` yet has none of them.
- Per-page `<html lang>`: Starlight's `docsSchema()` (0.42.4) has no `lang` frontmatter field
  and no way to set `<html lang>` for one page differently from the site's locale, short of
  making that page's folder its own Starlight locale — which was tried and rejected, because
  it makes Starlight's i18n layer treat that locale as a translation of the *whole* site and
  render every other page a second time under it as "untranslated fallback content"
  (duplicate routes, sidebar entries, and search index entries). Instead: `src/content.config.ts`
  extends `docsSchema()` with an optional `lang` field, and `src/routeData.ts` is registered
  as Starlight `routeMiddleware` to copy that frontmatter value into the route's `lang` and
  `entryMeta.lang` (which also drives the `lang` Starlight puts on `<main>`). Confirmed on a
  real build: `<html lang>` and `<main lang>` both flip to `en` on `/dev/` pages, `/editor/`
  stays `uk`. The import script (#3) sets `lang: en` on pages under `docs/dev/`; nothing keys
  off the folder name itself, so this also works if a future section needs a different
  language. Two accepted gaps: (1) route middleware runs after Starlight has already built
  the page's `<head>` tags, so `og:locale` stays the site's `uk` even on `/dev/` pages — a
  minor SEO nit, not worth reaching into `starlightRoute.head` for; (2) Pagefind's index
  (`dist/pagefind/pagefind-entry.json`) lists both `uk` and `en` once `/dev/` has real
  content — intentional, so a reader on a `/dev/` page searches English-tokenised content.
- "Edit this page" links are per page, not site-wide: there is no `editLink.baseUrl` in
  `astro.config.mjs` (that option makes Starlight build `baseUrl + entry.filePath`, i.e. a
  link into *this* repository's `src/content/docs/...`, which is never where doc text is
  edited). The import script (#3) instead writes an absolute `editUrl` into each imported
  page's frontmatter, pointing at the matching file in `tabula-cms/tabula` (mapping
  `index.md` back to `README.md`). The landing page (`src/content/docs/index.mdx`) isn't
  imported from anywhere, so it sets `editUrl: false` and shows no edit link at all.

## Commands

```sh
nvm use
npm ci
npm run docs:fetch   # stub until #3; #3 adds TABULA_DOCS_DIR for a local Tabula checkout
npm run dev
npm run build
npm test
```

## Related repositories

[`tabula-cms/tabula`](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula): default branch `develop`, `main`
is what's released. Its `docs/` folder layout: `INDEX.md`, `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/`,
`dev/`, `issues/` — `INDEX.md` and `issues/` are internal and are not published on this site.
Page language: `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/` are Ukrainian; `dev/` is English, imported with
`lang: en` in frontmatter — see the per-page `<html lang>` bullet in Conventions for how that
reaches the rendered page.

## Where decisions are recorded

The branch, deploy, and process model in this file was decided in issue #1 of this repository.
The overall plan and issue sequence is issue #10.
