## What this is

This repository is the public site of [Tabula](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula), a free,
open-source, self-hosted CMS for Ukrainian schools (AGPL-3.0). The site has two parts: (1)
documentation for schools and developers, built at build time from the `docs/` folder of
`tabula-cms/tabula`, and (2) — later — a catalogue of schools running Tabula (a Cloudflare
Worker + KV).

`tabula-cms/tabula` is the single source of truth for documentation text. This repository
never edits doc text; it only imports it. Everything else (site chrome, catalogue, CI, deploy)
lives here.

| `scripts/fetch-docs.mjs` | Imports `docs/{editor,install,qa,dev}` from `tabula-cms/tabula` into the gitignored `src/content/docs/{editor,install,qa,dev}/` (issue #3) — obtains the source (local dir or a sparse git clone), runs the transform, writes the output, prints a summary. See Conventions for the rules it implements. |
| `scripts/check-links.mjs` (`npm run check:links`; also runs automatically after `npm run build` via `postbuild`) | Walks the built `dist/` and fails if any internal link or `#anchor` resolves to nothing.

## Working process

1. The lead session (Fable) writes the spec into the issue (English for a technical spec,
   Ukrainian for a bug/content issue; acceptance criteria in Gherkin).
2. A work branch is created for it.
3. The `implementer` agent (Sonnet) writes the code/files from a brief written for that issue.
4. The `reviewer` agent (Opus) reviews the change against the issue's acceptance criteria and
   this file's conventions.
5. The implementer (or the lead) applies fixes from the review.
6. The lead session commits, pushes, and opens the pull request with `Closes #N`.
7. Merge after the `build` check is green.

Agents never run `git` (the reviewer may run read-only `git diff`/`git status`/`git log`).
Briefs live in the session scratchpad, not in this repository.

## Branch and deploy model

`main` is the only long-lived branch and is always live. Work branches are `feature/…`,
`fix/…`, `chore/…`, one PR per issue, squash merge allowed. `main` is protected and requires
the `build` check. Deploy target is GitHub Pages, built by GitHub Actions from `main`, with a
daily scheduled rebuild (so doc changes in `tabula-cms/tabula` reach the site without a PR
here). The site builds from `tabula-cms/tabula`'s `main` (its released state), not `develop`.
`deploy.yml` also takes a manual `workflow_dispatch` with a `tabula_ref` input (default
`main`), so a `develop` preview build can be triggered by hand; that preview is overwritten by
the next scheduled run against `main`. `SITE_URL` and `SITE_BASE` are repository variables
consumed by the build. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the manual repository settings this depends
on.

## Conventions

- Languages: user-facing text is Ukrainian; developer-facing files and code are English.
- Acceptance criteria: Gherkin keywords in English, scenario text in Ukrainian (Ukrainian
  issues) or English (English specs).
- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment next to
  it; Dependabot keeps both current.
- No real school, city, person, or domain anywhere in this repository. The only example school
  is the fictitious «Вигаданий ліцей № 0»; screenshots come only from the fixture school.
- Documentation text is never edited in this repository — fix it in `tabula-cms/tabula`.
- Generated doc folders (`src/content/docs/{editor,install,qa,dev}/`) are gitignored and never
  committed; `src/content/docs/index.mdx` (the landing page) is the only content file
  committed.
- Node: 22 (Astro 7 requires `>=22.12.0`); see `.nvmrc` and `package.json`'s `engines.node`.
- `astro.config.mjs`'s `site`/`base` default to the GitHub Pages project URL
  (`https://tabula-cms.github.io` / `/site`) and are overridden by the `SITE_URL`/`SITE_BASE`
  repository variables in CI; the custom domain later sets `SITE_BASE=/`. Internal links in
  `src/content/docs/index.mdx` (e.g. the hero actions) are written without a leading slash
  (`editor/`, not `/editor/`) so they resolve under either base — Starlight does not rewrite
  frontmatter link fields for the configured `base` itself.
- The sidebar's four groups (`editor`, `install`, `qa`, `dev`) are only added to
  `astro.config.mjs`'s `sidebar` array when the matching `src/content/docs/<dir>` folder
  exists (checked with `node:fs`'s `existsSync`). This is cosmetic, not a build requirement —
  an autogenerated group whose directory doesn't exist still builds fine, it would just show
  an empty group in the sidebar before that section has been imported. Those folders are
  generated by `scripts/fetch-docs.mjs` (issue #3) and gitignored, so a fresh clone that
  hasn't run `docs:fetch` yet has none of them.
- Per-page `<html lang>`: Starlight's `docsSchema()` (0.42.4) has no `lang` frontmatter field
  and no way to set `<html lang>` for one page differently from the site's locale, short of
  making that page's folder its own Starlight locale — which was tried and rejected, because
  it makes Starlight's i18n layer treat that locale as a translation of the *whole* site and
  render every other page a second time under it as "untranslated fallback content"
  (duplicate routes, sidebar entries, and search index entries). Instead: `src/content.config.ts`
  extends `docsSchema()` with an optional `lang` field, and `src/routeData.ts` is registered
  as Starlight `routeMiddleware` to copy that frontmatter value into the route's `lang` and
  `entryMeta.lang` (which also drives the `lang` Starlight puts on `<main>`). Confirmed on a
  real build: `<html lang>` and `<main lang>` both flip to `en` on `/dev/` pages, `/editor/`
  stays `uk`. The import script (#3) sets `lang: en` on pages under `docs/dev/`; nothing keys
  off the folder name itself, so this also works if a future section needs a different
  language. Two accepted gaps: (1) route middleware runs after Starlight has already built
  the page's `<head>` tags, so `og:locale` stays the site's `uk` even on `/dev/` pages — a
  minor SEO nit, not worth reaching into `starlightRoute.head` for; (2) Pagefind's index
  (`dist/pagefind/pagefind-entry.json`) lists both `uk` and `en` once `/dev/` has real
  content — intentional, so a reader on a `/dev/` page searches English-tokenised content.
- "Edit this page" links are per page, not site-wide: there is no `editLink.baseUrl` in
  `astro.config.mjs` (that option makes Starlight build `baseUrl + entry.filePath`, i.e. a
  link into *this* repository's `src/content/docs/...`, which is never where doc text is
  edited). The import script (#3) instead writes an absolute `editUrl` into each imported
  page's frontmatter, pointing at the matching file in `tabula-cms/tabula` (mapping
  `index.md` back to `README.md`). The landing page (`src/content/docs/index.mdx`) isn't
  imported from anywhere, so it sets `editUrl: false` and shows no edit link at all.
- Internal links inside imported pages are always emitted **relative**, computed from each
  page's own URL (`README.md` -> `/<folder>/`, `name.md` -> `/<folder>/<slug>/`), never with a
  leading slash: `path.posix.relative(fromUrl, toUrl) + '/'` (`./` when the two pages are the
  same), with `#anchor` appended verbatim — see `relativeHref()`/`rewriteLink()` in
  `scripts/lib/docs-transform.mjs`. This is the same reason as the index.mdx hero links above:
  Starlight does not prefix Markdown body links with `base` either. A link that leaves `docs/`,
  or lands in `docs/INDEX.md` (skipped, not published), becomes an absolute
  `https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula/blob/<TABULA_REF>/…` link instead; a link into
  `docs/audits/` or `docs/design/` (internal-only, and not even in the public `tabula-cms/tabula`
  tree, so likely a 404 on GitHub) does the same but also logs a warning, counted in
  `fetch-docs.mjs`'s summary (see issue #3). A page in one of the four imported folders that
  isn't Markdown (none exist today) is not treated as a page either, for the same absolute-link
  reason — `classifyRepoPath()` requires a `.md` extension. Link rewriting skips fenced code
  blocks (` ``` `/`~~~`, indentation and list-item nesting allowed) and inline code spans,
  so example Markdown quoted in the docs is never touched. Known limits: a closing fence must be
  the same length as the opening one, an unclosed fence is not treated as code, and 4-space
  indented code blocks are not detected (none of these occur in Tabula's docs today); a reference-style link
  definition (`[label]: url`), which this transform doesn't understand, is left alone and logged
  as a warning instead of silently mismatching.
- The sidebar replaces Tabula's own in-page navigation line. On the first non-blank line after
  the heading, when its first ` · `/` — `/` | `-separated segment is a leading `[←…](…)` link,
  every segment that is *pure navigation* is dropped: a link whose label starts with `←`; a link
  whose label ends with `→` (optionally preceded by `Далі:`, `Next:`, or `Далі —`); or any link
  (regardless of label) targeting `README.md` or `../INDEX.md`. Surviving segments are rejoined
  with ` · ` and go through normal link rewriting — several real Tabula pages put a genuine
  cross-reference on this line (e.g. `docs/dev/architecture.md`'s `[← Developer docs](README.md)
  · Deep reference: [\`CLAUDE.md\`](../../CLAUDE.md)`, where only the leading back-link is
  navigation), and only the navigation itself should disappear. A line with no leading `←` link
  is never touched. When nothing survives, the whole line is dropped, along with the blank
  line(s) that leaves at the top — see `removeBackLink()` in `scripts/lib/docs-transform.mjs`.
- `sidebar.order` for an imported page comes from its 1-based first-appearance rank as
  `](<folder>/<file>)` in `docs/INDEX.md` (`index.md` is always `0`, overriding whatever rank
  it computes to); pages missing from `INDEX.md` sort after the known ones, alphabetically.
  Gaps in the numbering (e.g. `README.md`'s own rank never being used) are harmless — Starlight
  only needs a consistent relative order.
- `lang: en` is set only on pages imported from `docs/dev/`; nothing else keys off folder names,
  so the rule is really "the import script sets `lang`", not "the `dev/` folder is special" —
  see the per-page `<html lang>` bullet above.
- Link checking is `scripts/check-links.mjs`, run automatically after every `npm run build` via
  npm's `postbuild` hook (also runnable on its own as `npm run check:links`), not
  `starlight-links-validator`: that plugin's `errorOnRelativeLinks` option is all-or-nothing
  (error on every relative link, or silently skip validating every relative link *and its
  anchor* — confirmed by reading its source and by a build with a deliberately broken relative
  link and anchor under `errorOnRelativeLinks: false`, which reported no errors at all). Since
  this site's whole link convention is relative links, that plugin cannot validate them, so
  `check-links.mjs` walks the built `dist/` HTML directly instead: every `<a href>` that isn't a
  URI scheme (`http(s):`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, …) or a protocol-relative `//host/...` URL must
  resolve to a file under `dist/`, and any `#fragment` — including a bare same-page one — must
  match an `id` on the target page.

## Related repositories

[`tabula-cms/tabula`](https://github.com/tabula-cms/tabula): default branch `develop`, `main`
is what's released. Its `docs/` folder layout: `INDEX.md`, `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/`,
`dev/`, `issues/` — `INDEX.md` and `issues/` are internal and are not published on this site.
Page language: `editor/`, `install/`, `qa/` are Ukrainian; `dev/` is English, imported with
`lang: en` in frontmatter — see the per-page `<html lang>` bullet in Conventions for how that
reaches the rendered page.

## Where decisions are recorded

The branch, deploy, and process model in this file was decided in issue #1 of this repository.
The overall plan and issue sequence is issue #10.
